## üìö Research Paper

The research paper, **"Antimagic Labeling of Graphs Using Prime Numbers"**, focuses on assigning distinct prime values to the edges of graphs in a way that ensures the cumulative sum of edge labels at each vertex remains unique. The paper proposes a conjecture on antimagic labeling for any graph and proves two theories. The paper is available on arXiv:
